When the user clicked a link, the browser nagiates to a new page, sending a request to the web server, this can
make the application slow and spend a lot of bandwidth and server CPU.

# SPAs single page applications

This type of applications allows to the user to navigate on the website without downloading
entire new webpages, this is faster because it only rewrite the current one.
